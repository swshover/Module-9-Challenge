# Module-9-Challenge
Both the table creation and queries are in the same file. At the top, there is a DROP TABLE IF EXISTS list in case there are pre-existing tables that need to be dropped.
If that is the case, then the data would need to be imported.
As I mentioned in the Table creation section, we were not given enough information to determine what data is vital and what isn't for data analytics
Therefore, we really do not know what is allowed to have NULL values and what doesn't. I explained slightly more in the SQL file.
